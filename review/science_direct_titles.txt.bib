abstract = "Transportation systems have become much more vulnerable due to the increased amount of unexpected severe weather events caused by the effects of climate change. One of the direct consequences is that the punctuality of transportation systems is severely affected and the prediction of the on-time performance of scheduled service becomes challenging due to the uncertainty of severe weather’s occurrence. The objective of this paper is to investigate two fundamental questions pertaining to the operational reliability of passenger transportation systems, using high-speed rail (HSR) and aviation in China as an example: what are the impacts of severe weather events on HSR and aviation delays, and to what extent are these systems vulnerable to various types of severe weather events? To address these questions, a dataset with 350,000 detailed, on-time performance records of HSR and air services for the period October 2016–September 2017 was adopted. Based on data visualization and statistical analysis, the study reveals that the impacts of severe weather events on HSR and aviation’s on-time performance vary spatially and temporally. In general, HSR is less vulnerable than aviation to most severe weather events. In terms of the spatial variation, the operation of HSR in the southeast coastal region is affected more frequently by rain and thunderstorms, whereas the system operated in central-eastern China is more vulnerable to snowstorms."

abstract = "In train planning and timetabling, the trip time on each link is assumed to depend on the type of train and characteristics of the link, but is usually treated as independent of the time interval (headway) between trains. However, in practice trains are subject to delays from a variety of causes, and since normally they are not allowed to pass each other on a link, any delay to one train may cause “knock-on” delays to following trains. This is especially true of the high density double and multiple track railways in Britain and Europe. The shorter the scheduled headway between trains, the greater is the expected knock-on delay and hence the greater the expected trip times of following trains. We develop simple stochastic approximations to these knock-on train delays. To test and calibrate the approximations, we conduct detailed stochastic simulation of the interaction between trains as they traverse sections of the link. The approximate relationships that we derive between scheduled headways and knock-on delays can be used, for example, (a) to provide correction factors for other stochastic or deterministic models of train planning, dispatching, or control; (b) to adjust train timetables, which are currently produced without explicitly considering the expected knock-on effects, and (c) to make it feasible to conduct larger scale simulations of train networks, by reducing or removing the need to simulate behaviour within each link."

abstract = "Maintaining high on-time performance and at the same time having high capacity utilization is a challenge for several railway traffic systems and especially those with heterogeneous traffic. With high capacity utilization the system is sensitive to disturbances and delays could easily propagate in the network. One way to handle this problem is to create more robust timetables; timetables that can absorb delays and prevent them from propagating. This paper presents an optimization approach to reduce the propagation of delays by introducing a more efficient margin time allocation in the timetable. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is proposed, in which the existing margin time is re-allocated to increase the robustness of an existing timetable. The model re-allocates both runtime and headway margin time to increase the robustness at specific delay sensitive points in a timetable, a suitable approach for double-track lines with dense heterogeneous traffic. We illustrate the applicability of the approach in a real-world case, where an initial timetable is modified into new timetables with increased robustness. These new timetables are then evaluated and compared to the initial timetable. We evaluate how the re-allocation of margin time affects the timetable structure and the timetable's capability to handle disturbances by exposing it to some minor initial disturbances in the range of 5–10 min. The results show that it is possible to reduce the delays by re-allocating the existing margin time. For example, the total delay at end station decreases with 10% in our real-world example."

For scheduled services with high reliability and long headways, the value of delays is most commonly assumed to be proportional to the average delay. By exploring how the valuation of train delays depends on delay risk and delay length, using three different stated choice data sets, we find that the “average delay” approach does not hold: the disutility increases slower than linearly in the delay risk. This means that using the average delay as a performance indicator, a guide for operations planning or for investment appraisal will underestimate the value of small risks of long delays relative to large risks for short delays. It also means that estimated valuations of “average delay” will depend on the delay risk level: valuations will be higher the lower the risk levels in the study are."

The algorithm is a combination of simulation and optimization. The simulation part consists of a train traffic simulator and a passenger flow simulator which work in parallel. The train traffic simulator forecasts future train diagrams considering the dynamic interaction between trains and passengers. The passenger flow simulator traces behaviour of all the passengers one by one and calculates how many passengers get on/off at each station. This information is given to the train traffic simulator and necessary dwell times are calculated. Passengers’ dissatisfaction is also estimated from the results of the passenger flow simulation. In the optimization part, we use the tabu search algorithm. We will show the details of our algorithm together with numerical results using real world data."

This paper presents a model and an algorithm to compute the propagation of initial delays over a periodic railway timetable. The railway system is modelled as a linear system in max-plus algebra including zero-order dynamics corresponding to delay propagation within a timetable period. A timed event graph representation is exploited in an effective graph algorithm that computes the propagation of train delays using a bucket implementation to store the propagated delays. The behaviour of the delay propagation and the convergence of the algorithm is analysed depending on timetable properties such as realisability and stability. Different types of delays and delay behaviour are discussed, including primary and secondary delays, structural delays, periodic delay regimes, and delay explosion. A decomposition method based on linearity is introduced to deal with structural and initial delays separately. The algorithm can be applied to large-scale scheduled railway traffic networks in real-time applications such as interactive timetable stability analysis and decision support systems to assist train dispatchers."

It has become a challenging problem in the operations and management of urban railway transit networks because of high complexities in coordination among lines. In this paper, we propose a rescheduling model for last trains with the consideration of train delays caused by incidents that occurred in train operations. In the model, two aspects are considered. On one hand, we try to minimize the running time and the dwell time, and to maximize the average transfer redundant time and the network accessibility. On the other hand, we expect to minimize the difference between the original timetable and the rescheduled one. A genetic algorithm is developed to solve this problem. The case study of Beijing railway transit network shows that once a delay occurs in a section, the most effective way to adjust the timetable consists of adjusting the running time of trains that have strong transfer relationships with the delay section. If the delay is not substantially long, the suggested model would neutralize the influence of the delay."

To prevent possible deviations from the scheduled times, time allowances are added to the process times (i.e., running times) as time supplements and to the time interval between successive trains (i.e., minimum headway) as buffer times. The amount of time allowances is decided during the timetable planning process and their contribution to the service quality is monitored in actual operation. The adequacy of time allowances results in punctual train operations, which is one of the primary interests of service users and providers. Because the sequence of train departure and arrival times can be viewed as a stochastic process, the performance of train operations may be analyzed and modeled using Markov chains. We modeled train departure and arrival delays at stations as states and analyzed the successive state changes along train paths in a single track railway. This allowed us to predict train states at certain event time steps and to estimate steady-state delay probabilities. The former may be used to reschedule train movements and the latter to measure timetable robustness."

Such events disrupt the deployment of resources and cause delay to passengers. Obtaining a reliable disruption length estimation can potentially reduce the negative impact caused by the disruption. Different factors such as the location, cause of disruption, traffic density, etc. can determine the disruption length. The uncertainty inherent to the variability of each factor and the unavailability of sufficient data results in a wide distribution of disruption lengths from which a certain value should be selected as the length prediction. The rescheduling measure considered in this research is short-turning the trains that are heading to the disrupted area. To investigate the impact of the disruption length estimates on the rescheduling strategy and the resulting passengers delays, this research presents a framework consisting of three models: a disruption length model, short-turning model and passenger assignment model. The framework is applied to a part of the Dutch railway network. The results show the effects of short (optimistic) and long (pessimistic) estimates on the number of affected passengers, generalized travel time and number of passengers rerouting and transferring."

This paper proposes a new analytical stochastic model of train delay propagation in stations, which estimates the knock-on delays of trains caused by route conflicts and late transfer connections realistically. The proposed model reflects the constraints of signalling system and train protection operations rules. The stochastic variations of track occupancy times due to the fluctuations of train speed in case of different signal aspects are modelled with conditional probability distributions. The model is solved on the basis of a numerical approximation of the Stieltjes convolution of individual independent distributions and can be integrated into a larger computerized decision support tool for timetable design and train dispatching. Having been validated successfully with empirical data, the model is applied for optimizing the station capacity utilization in a case study of the Dutch railway station The Hague Holland Spoor. The model can determine the maximal frequency of trains passing the critical level crossing with a given maximum knock-on delay at a certain confidence level. It is found that when the scheduled buffer time between train paths at the level crossing decreases, the mean knock-on delay of all passing trains increases exponentially."

On the one hand, train scheduling models are designed to include all conditions relevant to feasible and efficient operation of rail services, from the viewpoint of operations managers. On the other hand, delay management models focus on the impact of rescheduling decisions on the quality of service perceived by the passengers. Models in the first stream are mainly microscopic, while models in the second stream are mainly macroscopic. This paper aims at merging these two streams of research by developing microscopic passenger-centric models, solution algorithms and lower bounds. Several fast heuristic methods are proposed, based on alternative decompositions of the model. A lower bound is proposed, consisting of the resolution of a set of min-cost flow problems with activation constraints. Computational experiments, based on multiple test cases of the real-world Dutch railway network, show that good quality solutions and lower bounds can be found within a limited computation time."

A number of potential delay mitigation tactics are introduced and evaluated to assess their potential worth in mitigating delays that may arise within the system. They are then analysed using the simulation model that has been developed, and compared to a system with no delay mitigation tactics input. The potential benefits and the feasibility of such tactics are then evaluated, alongside an appraisal of the scale of delay that can reasonably be mitigated through the proposed tactics alone.

In this paper, a passenger's alternative choices, such as selecting another route, waiting, and switching to other transportation modes, and the corresponding influence mechanism are analyzed in detail. Given train time–space diagrams and the time-varying travel demands between the origin and destination (O–D), a dynamic simulation model of passenger flow distribution on schedule-based transit networks with train delays is proposed. Animation demonstration and statistical indices, including the passenger flow volume of each train and station, can be generated from simulation results. A numerical example is given to illustrate the application of the proposed model. Numerical results indicate that, compared with conventional methods, the proposed model performs better for a passenger flow distribution with train delays."

Finally, this paper suggested a practical method to recover the knock-on delays. The result shows that keeping a moderate separation between trains with necessary adjustment at the departure time, under the delay situation, was found to be an effective measure. The measures can shorten the travel time and recover the train delay earlier."

This paper considers the problem of finding a timetable for a given set of departures that minimizes the weighted sum of scheduled travel time and expected delay, thereby capturing these two important socio-economic properties of a timetable. To accurately represent the complex secondary delays in operational railway traffic, an approach combining microscopic simulation and macroscopic timetable optimization is proposed. To predict the expected delay in the macroscopic timetable, a surrogate function is formulated, as well as a subproblem to calibrate the parameters in the model. In a set of computational experiments, the approach increased the socio-economic benefit by 2–5% and improved the punctuality by 8–25%."

The dynamics of a train delay over time and space is presented as a stochastic process that describes the evolution of the time-dependent random variable. This approach is further extended by modelling the interdependence between trains that share the same infrastructure or have a scheduled passenger transfer. The model is applied on a set of historical traffic realisation data from the part of a busy corridor in Sweden. We present the results and analyse the accuracy of predictions as well as the evolution of probability distributions of event delays over time.

But only the planned nominal waiting times have been addressed, whereas delays as they occur in daily operations have been neglected. Delays have been rather treated mainly in an online context and solved as a separate optimization problem, called delay management. We provide the first computational study which aims at computing delay resistant periodic timetables. In particular we assess the delay resistance of a timetable by evaluating it subject to several delay scenarios to which optimum delay management will be applied. We arrive at computing delay resistant timetables by selecting a new objective function which we design to be somehow in the middle of the traditional simple timetabling objective and the sophisticated delay management objective. This is a slight extension of the concept of “light robustness” (LR) as it has been proposed by Fischetti and Monaci [2006. Robust optimization through branch-and-price. In: Proceedings of AIRO]. Moreover, in our application we are able to provide accurate interpretations for the ingredients of LR. We apply this new technique to real-world data of a part of the German railway network of Deutsche Bahn AG. Our computational results suggest that a significant decrease of passenger delays can be obtained at a relatively small price of robustness, i.e. by increasing the nominal travel times of the passengers."

We first use historical data to rationalize the dependency graph of the developed structures. Each BN structure is then trained with the gold standard k-fold cross validation approach to avoid over-fitting and evaluate its performance against the others. Overall, the validation results indicate that a BN-based model can be an efficient tool for capturing superposition and interaction effects of train delays. However, a well-designed hybrid BN structure, developed based on domain knowledge and judgments of expertise and local authorities, can outperform the other models. We present a performance comparison of the predictions obtained from the hybrid BN structure against the real-world benchmark data.

This train arrival model is completely analyzed by means of a generating-functions approach. An explicit expression for the probability generating function (pgf) of the buffer contents is obtained. Furthermore, a simple relationship is derived between the pgf of the buffer contents and the pgf of the packet delay in a discrete-time G/D/1 queueing system, which is, of course, also valid for the train arrivals case. Finding this simple and general relationship is one of the contributions of this paper. The pgf of the message delay is obtained as well. Some numerical results are presented.

The underlying models range from rules of thumb to complete network optimizations. Almost none of them account for uncertainties regarding future delays. In this paper, we present a multi-stage stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) model to make wait-depart decisions in the presence of uncertain future delays. The SDP approach explicitly accounts for potential recourse actions at later stations in a look-ahead manner when making the decision in the current stage. The objective is to minimize the total delay experienced by passengers at their final station by recursively solving Bellman equations. We focus on a single train line but consider the effects on direct feeder and connecting trains. In an extensive numerical study, we compare the solution quality and computational effort of the SDP to other optimization approaches and simple heuristic decision rules that are frequently used in delay management. The SDP approach outperforms the other approaches in almost every scenario with regard to solution quality in reasonable time and seems to be a promising starting point for stochastic dynamic delay management with interesting future research opportunities."

In the proposed method, golden section search is adopted to identify the optimal train speed at the time of signal upgrade in the conflicting area, which enables the train to depart from the conflicting area as soon as possible. A heuristic method is then developed to attain the train control scheme to realize the optimal train speed at the time of signal upgrade in the conflicting area. Simulation study indicates that the proposed method enables the train to across the conflicting area with smaller run-time and therefore leads to larger delay reduction, in comparison with the traditional maximum speed control method and the green wave control method."

Optimisation algorithms can be used to: minimise the cost of delays; find solutions to recover disturbed scenarios back to the operating timetable; improve railway traffic fluidity on high capacity lines; and improve headway regulation. A number of researchers have previously considered the problem of minimising the costs of train delays and have used various optimisation algorithms for differing scenarios. However, little work has been carried out to evaluate and compare the different approaches. This paper compares and contrasts a number of optimisation approaches that have been previously used and applies them to a series of common scenarios. The approaches considered are: brute force, first-come-first-served, Tabu search, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, ant colony optimisation, dynamic programming and decision tree based elimination. It is found that simple disturbances (i.e. one train delayed) can be managed efficiently using straightforward approaches, such as first-come-first-served. For more complex scenarios, advanced methods are found to be more appropriate. For the scenarios considered in this paper, ant colony optimisation and genetic algorithms performed well, the delay cost is decreased by 30% and 28%, respectively, compared with first-come-first-served."

By monitoring the power/timing information of a synchronous circuit, an attacker can easily obtain the secret data stored on the device. Although dual-rail asynchronous circuits have more stable power traces, they are still vulnerable to power-based attacks because of the imbalanced loads between the two rails of each signal. Moreover, asynchronous circuits are among the most prone to timing attacks since their delays are strongly data dependent. Dual-spacer dual-rail delay-insensitive Logic (D3L), presented in this paper, is able to mitigate both power- and timing-based side-channel attacks. In a D3L circuit, power consumption is decoupled from data pattern by using a dual-spacer protocol which guarantees balanced switching activities between the two rails of each signal, while timing-data correlation is broken by inserting random delays. Three Advanced Encryption Standard cores have been designed using synchronous logic, traditional dual-rail asynchronous logic, and D3L. Correlation Power Analysis and Timing Analysis attacks were applied and the results show that the D3L design is able to render both attacks unsuccessful, while the other two circuits have vulnerabilities."

The running and waiting times for trains can increase unexpectedly, creating primary delays that cause knock-on delays and delays for other trains. The accurate estimation of train delays is important for creating timetables, dispatching trains, and planning infrastructures. In this work, we proposed a fuzzy Petri net (FPN) model for estimating train delays. The FPN model with characteristics of hierarchy, colour, time, and fuzzy reasoning was used to simulate traffic processes and train movements in a railway system. The trains were coloured tokens, the track sections were termed places, and discrete events of train movement were termed transitions. The train primary delays were simulated by a fuzzy Petri net module in the model. The fuzzy logic system was incorporated in the FPN module in two ways. First, when there were no historical data on train delays, expert knowledge was used to define fuzzy sets and rules, transforming the expertise into a model to calculate train delays. Second, a model based on the Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was used for systems where the historical data on train delays were available (from detection systems or from the train dispatcher’s logs). The delay data were used to train the neuro-fuzzy ANFIS model. After the results of the fuzzy logic system were verified, the ANFIS model was replicated by a fuzzy Petri net. The simulation was validated by animating the train movement and plotting the time-distance graph of the trains. Results of the simulation were exported to a database for additional data mining and comparative analysis. The FPN model was tested on a part of the Belgrade railway node."

A ‘traverse’ means a passage across a level crossing by a road user, who may be a pedestrian, cyclist, or occupant of a road vehicle. The paper finds that the road users with the highest fatality rate per traverse are pedestrians at passive crossings. Their rate is about three orders of magnitude higher than that of users with the lowest risk, who are road vehicle occupants at railway-controlled crossings. The paper considers the choice between automatic and railway-controlled crossings on public roads. Railway-controlled crossings are widely used in Britain. They are about one order of magnitude safer than automatic crossings, but they impose greater delays on users. A formula is developed to give the overall delay to road users at either type of crossing in terms of the numbers of road users and trains per day, and in terms of the length of time that the crossing must be closed to the road to allow the passage of one train. It is found that automatic level crossings cause substantially less delay than railway-controlled level crossings. The official monetary values of road user delay and of preventing a fatality were used to estimate the valuations of delays and fatalities at hypothetical but representative automatic and railway-controlled crossings. These valuations were then used to explore the effect of replacing representative railway-controlled with automatic crossings or vice-versa. It is found that the valuation of the reduced delays from adopting automatic crossings typically outweighs the valuation of the losses from the increased casualties. However, in practice Britain has chosen to retain a large number of railway-controlled crossings, which implies accepting the delays in return for a good level crossing safety record. Finally, an analysis is carried out to determine the additional risk of typical car and walk journeys that involve traversing a level crossing compared with similar journeys that do not. It is found that the additional risk is small for motor vehicle journeys, but substantial for walk journeys."

This complex and time consuming task is however made more difficult by additional requirements to make train schedules robust to delays and other disruptions. For a timetable to be regarded as robust, it should be insensitive to delays of a specified level and its performance with respect to a given metric, should be within given tolerances. In other words the effect of delays should be identifiable and should be shown to be minimal. To this end, a sensitivity analysis is proposed that identifies affected operations. More specifically a sensitivity analysis for determining what operation delays cause each operation to be affected is proposed. The information provided by this analysis gives another measure of timetable robustness and also provides control information that can be used when delays occur in practice. Several algorithms are proposed to identify this information and they utilise a disjunctive graph model of train operations. Upon completion the sets of affected operations can also be used to define the impact of all delays without further disjunctive graph evaluations."

abstract = "Buffer times are an important factor in railway timetable design preventing the propagation of delays and ensuring timetable robustness. Determining the required amount of buffer times, such that a certain level of service quality is achieved, falls within the responsibility of railway capacity analysis. This is why capacity analysis is intrinsically linked to delay propagation modelling. Currently, delay propagation modelling in this context relies on the assumption of random, exponentially distributed or deterministic buffer times. Real-world timetables tend to deviate from this behaviour, such that a more general modelling of buffer time distributions is desirable. In this paper the impact of different buffer time distributions on the build-up of knock-on delays in delay propagation modelling is analysed using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach. It is shown that the choice of distribution has a significant impact on performance metrics. In a sensitivity analysis line capacity is observed to vary by as much as 17% as a function of the underlying buffer time statistics in the investigated scenarios."

abstract = "To route and schedule trains over a large complex network can be computationally intensive. One way to reduce complexity could be to “aggregate” suitable sections of a network. In this paper, we present a simulation-based technique to generate delay estimates over track segments as a function of traffic conditions, as well as network topology. We test our technique by comparing the delay estimates obtained for a network in Los Angeles with the delays obtained from the simulation model developed by Lu et al. [Lu, Q., Dessouky, M.M., Leachman, R.C., 2004. Modeling of train movements through complex networks. ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation 14, 48–75], which has been shown to be representative of the real-world delay values. Railway dispatchers could route and schedule freight trains over large networks by using our technique to estimate delay across aggregated network sections."

abstract = "With changes in the global climate, the occurrence of severe weather events appears to be becoming ever more frequent. As a result of this, vital transport networks are becoming increasingly exposed to disruption or disablement due to weather related incidents. In order to adapt to these changing conditions it is important to gain an understanding of how weather currently impacts transport systems. This paper presents the results of a statistical analysis of the impact of weather conditions on the performance of metropolitan commuter rail based upon observations made on the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) rail system. Utilising a dataset comprising daily performance observations for 30 train services operating across the DART network, this research applies a number of multiple regression models to gain an understanding of the role of weather, temporal effects, and resulting interactions, on delays experienced by the network. While research in this area has traditional focused on the impact of single events, this study presents an examination of the role of multiple factors and their interactions. With regard to temporal effects, the largest delays are observed in the last third of the year, with peak delays occurring in November. Delays due to adverse weather conditions are observed, with rain being the primary factor related to poor performance. Interactions between different weather conditions, particularly wind and rain, as well as between weather conditions and the month in which a journey took place were also observed to be significant and resulting in delays to services."

abstract = "Rail systems are highly complex and their control in real time requires mathematical–computational tools. The main aim of these tools is to perform swift optimal rescheduling in response to disruptions or delays caused by events not foreseen in the original plans, so that there is no knock-on effect on other services due to these primary delays. This paper proposes a novel weighted train delay based on demand approach based on the alternative graph concept for rescheduling passenger train services. This problem is formulated as a binary integer linear programming problem which tries to maximize consumer satisfaction by minimizing total passenger delay at destinations. A heuristic method, the so-called Avoid Most Delayed Alternative Arc (AMDAA) algorithm, is proposed to solve the model. AMDAA is an adaptation of Avoid Maximum Current Cmax (AMCC) developed by Mascis and Pacciarelli (2002) to the new model. A numerical comparison is carried out with AMDAA, a Branch-and-Cut method, AMCC and the heuristic First Come First Served (FCFS). Numerical research carried out with data from the Renfe Cercanias Madrid rail network (Spain) shows the high computational performance in real applications of the algorithms and the suitability of this weighted train delay based on demand model versus the classical makespan minimization approach."

abstract = "Knock-on delay, which is the key factor in punctuality of railway service, is mainly related to two factors including the quality of timetable in the planning phase and disturbances which may result in unscheduled trains’ waiting or meeting in operation phase. If the delay root cause and the interactions among the factors responsible for these can be clearly clarified, then the punctuality of railway operations can be enhanced by taking reactions such as timetable adjustment, rescheduling or rerouting of railway traffic in case of disturbances. These delay reasons can be used to predict the lengths of railway disruptions and effective reactions can be applied in disruption management. In this work, a delay root cause discovery model is proposed, which integrates heterogeneous railway operation data sources to reconstruct the details of the railway operations. A supervised decision tree method following the machine learning and data mining techniques is designed to estimate the key factors in knock-on delays. It discovers the root cause delay factor by logically analyzing the scheduled or un-scheduled trains meetings and overtaking behaviors, and the subsequent delay propagations. Experiment results show that the proposed decision tree can predict the delay reason with the accuracy of 83%, and it can be further enhance to 90% if the delay cause is only considered “prolonged passengers boarding” and “meeting or overtaking” factors. The delay root cause can be discovered by the proposed model, verified by frequency filtering in operation records, and resolved by the adjustment of timetable which is an important reference for the next timetable rescheduling. The results of this study can be applied to railway operation decision support and disruption management, especially with regard to timetable rescheduling, trains resequencing or rerouting, system reliability analysis, and service quality improvements."

abstract = "Railway service quality can be measured by the aggregate delay over a time horizon due to an event that delays a given train. Timetables for railway services may dampen delay propagations to subsequent trains by adding either supplement time or buffer time to the timetable. The evaluation of these variables is often performed by time consuming analysis with simulation software, or other complex, time-consuming calculations. This paper proposes instead an analytical closed form formulation of aggregate delay, which offers theoretical insights into railway delays and managerial insight into the properties of timetables at an aggregate level, and which may function as a fast sub-algorithm for timetable evaluations in larger optimization and transport models. Analysis of the function recommends a restraint in the utilization of timetable supplement and buffer, as their delay-damping effect decreases with their magnitude. Further, the effect of different threshold values in delay measurement is demonstrated, giving information valuable to the design of service contracts. Numerical analysis of a common suburban railway line shows that the polynomial function provides guidance and insight even when theoretical assumptions are violated."

abstract = "A large-scale ensemble prediction model to predict train delays is presented. The ensemble model uses a disparate set of models, two statistical and one simulation-based to generate forecasts of train delays. The first statistical model is a context-aware random forest that accounts for network traffic states, such as likely stretch conflicts and current headway’s, exogenous weather, event, and work zone information. The second model is a kernel regression that captures train-specific dynamics. A mesoscopic simulation model that accounts for travel and dwell time variations as well as inferred track occupation conflicts, train connections and rolling stock rotations, is additionally considered. The models have been used in a proof of concept to forecast delays for nationwide passenger services network of Deutsche Bahn, which operates roughly 25,000 trains daily in Germany. Results demonstrate a 25% improvement potential in forecast correctness (fraction of predictions within one minute) and 50% reduction in root mean squared errors compared to the published schedule. The paper describes the models along with the big data challenges that were addressed in data storage, feature and model building, and computation."

Here, we investigate train exposure time to bad weather and its influence on an important railway operation problem, train delay. We find that train delay is more likely to occur in snow and rain weather and the total train delay time is in a good correlation with the train exposure time to bad weather. We also develop a train delay network to identify the communities of railway stations from the perspective of train delay co-occurrence. The obtained community structure can be potentially useful in designing regional management strategy for delayed trains."
