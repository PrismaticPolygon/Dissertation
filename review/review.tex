\section*{Abstract}

Context: Train delays impose a huge cost on passengers and operators. Systems which predict 
delays can ameliorate this cost by informing the creation of timetables, improving real-time
passenger information systems and improving delay management systems. 

Objective: The goal of this work is to synthesise available research results to inform
evidence-based selection of train delay prediction techniques (TDPT)

Method: Relevant studies about TDPTs were gathered via a systematic literature review

Results: We selected 21 peer-reviewed studies of TDPTs. The techniques are evaluated.

All of the TDPTs are evaluated with a variety of evaluation metrics.
