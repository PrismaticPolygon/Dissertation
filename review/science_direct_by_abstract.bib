abstract = "In train planning and timetabling, the trip time on each link is assumed to depend on the type of train and characteristics of the link, but is usually treated as independent of the time interval (headway) between trains. However, in practice trains are subject to delays from a variety of causes, and since normally they are not allowed to pass each other on a link, any delay to one train may cause “knock-on” delays to following trains. This is especially true of the high density double and multiple track railways in Britain and Europe. The shorter the scheduled headway between trains, the greater is the expected knock-on delay and hence the greater the expected trip times of following trains. We develop simple stochastic approximations to these knock-on train delays. To test and calibrate the approximations, we conduct detailed stochastic simulation of the interaction between trains as they traverse sections of the link. The approximate relationships that we derive between scheduled headways and knock-on delays can be used, for example, (a) to provide correction factors for other stochastic or deterministic models of train planning, dispatching, or control; (b) to adjust train timetables, which are currently produced without explicitly considering the expected knock-on effects, and (c) to make it feasible to conduct larger scale simulations of train networks, by reducing or removing the need to simulate behaviour within each link."

abstract = "In scheduled railway traffic networks a single delayed train may cause a domino effect of secondary delays over the entire network, which is a main concern to planners and dispatchers. This paper presents a model and an algorithm to compute the propagation of initial delays over a periodic railway timetable. The railway system is modelled as a linear system in max-plus algebra including zero-order dynamics corresponding to delay propagation within a timetable period. A timed event graph representation is exploited in an effective graph algorithm that computes the propagation of train delays using a bucket implementation to store the propagated delays. The behaviour of the delay propagation and the convergence of the algorithm is analysed depending on timetable properties such as realisability and stability. Different types of delays and delay behaviour are discussed, including primary and secondary delays, structural delays, periodic delay regimes, and delay explosion. A decomposition method based on linearity is introduced to deal with structural and initial delays separately. The algorithm can be applied to large-scale scheduled railway traffic networks in real-time applications such as interactive timetable stability analysis and decision support systems to assist train dispatchers."

abstract = "Train movements are subject to disturbances and disruptions, which may cause late departures and/or late arrivals at particular locations (e.g., terminals, stations, crossings) with respect to their pre-determined times. To prevent possible deviations from the scheduled times, time allowances are added to the process times (i.e., running times) as time supplements and to the time interval between successive trains (i.e., minimum headway) as buffer times. The amount of time allowances is decided during the timetable planning process and their contribution to the service quality is monitored in actual operation. The adequacy of time allowances results in punctual train operations, which is one of the primary interests of service users and providers. Because the sequence of train departure and arrival times can be viewed as a stochastic process, the performance of train operations may be analyzed and modeled using Markov chains. We modeled train departure and arrival delays at stations as states and analyzed the successive state changes along train paths in a single track railway. This allowed us to predict train states at certain event time steps and to estimate steady-state delay probabilities. The former may be used to reschedule train movements and the latter to measure timetable robustness."

Instead, they rely on static rules built by experts of the railway infrastructure based on classical univariate statistic. The purpose of this paper is to build a data-driven Train Delay Prediction System (TDPS) for large-scale railway networks which exploits the most recent big data technologies, learning algorithms, and statistical tools. In particular, we propose a fast learning algorithm for Shallow and Deep Extreme Learning Machines that fully exploits the recent in-memory large-scale data processing technologies for predicting train delays. Proposal has been compared with the current state-of-the-art TDPSs. Results on real world data coming from the Italian railway network show that our proposal is able to improve over the current state-of-the-art TDPSs."

This method can efficiently represent and compute the complex stochastic inference between random variables. Moreover, it allows updating the probability distributions and reducing the uncertainty of future train delays in real time under the assumption that more information continuously becomes available from the monitoring system. The dynamics of a train delay over time and space is presented as a stochastic process that describes the evolution of the time-dependent random variable. This approach is further extended by modelling the interdependence between trains that share the same infrastructure or have a scheduled passenger transfer. The model is applied on a set of historical traffic realisation data from the part of a busy corridor in Sweden. We present the results and analyse the accuracy of predictions as well as the evolution of probability distributions of event delays over time. The presented method is important for making better predictions for train traffic, that are not only based on static, offline collected data, but are able to positively include the dynamic characteristics of the continuously changing delays."

abstract = "We present a Bayesian network-(BN) based train delay prediction model to tackle the complexity and dependency nature of train operations. Three different BN schemes, namely, heuristic hill-climbing, primitive linear and hybrid structure, are investigated using real-world train operation data from a high-speed railway line. We first use historical data to rationalize the dependency graph of the developed structures. Each BN structure is then trained with the gold standard k-fold cross validation approach to avoid over-fitting and evaluate its performance against the others. Overall, the validation results indicate that a BN-based model can be an efficient tool for capturing superposition and interaction effects of train delays. However, a well-designed hybrid BN structure, developed based on domain knowledge and judgments of expertise and local authorities, can outperform the other models. We present a performance comparison of the predictions obtained from the hybrid BN structure against the real-world benchmark data. The results show that the proposed model on overage can achieve over 80% accuracy in predictions within a 60-min horizon, yielding low prediction errors regarding mean absolute error (MAE), mean error (ME) and root mean square error (RMSE) measures."

abstract = "Even with the most accurate timetable, trains often operate with delays. The running and waiting times for trains can increase unexpectedly, creating primary delays that cause knock-on delays and delays for other trains. The accurate estimation of train delays is important for creating timetables, dispatching trains, and planning infrastructures. In this work, we proposed a fuzzy Petri net (FPN) model for estimating train delays. The FPN model with characteristics of hierarchy, colour, time, and fuzzy reasoning was used to simulate traffic processes and train movements in a railway system. The trains were coloured tokens, the track sections were termed places, and discrete events of train movement were termed transitions. The train primary delays were simulated by a fuzzy Petri net module in the model. The fuzzy logic system was incorporated in the FPN module in two ways. First, when there were no historical data on train delays, expert knowledge was used to define fuzzy sets and rules, transforming the expertise into a model to calculate train delays. Second, a model based on the Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was used for systems where the historical data on train delays were available (from detection systems or from the train dispatcher’s logs). The delay data were used to train the neuro-fuzzy ANFIS model. After the results of the fuzzy logic system were verified, the ANFIS model was replicated by a fuzzy Petri net. The simulation was validated by animating the train movement and plotting the time-distance graph of the trains. Results of the simulation were exported to a database for additional data mining and comparative analysis. The FPN model was tested on a part of the Belgrade railway node."

abstract = "Knock-on delay, which is the key factor in punctuality of railway service, is mainly related to two factors including the quality of timetable in the planning phase and disturbances which may result in unscheduled trains’ waiting or meeting in operation phase. If the delay root cause and the interactions among the factors responsible for these can be clearly clarified, then the punctuality of railway operations can be enhanced by taking reactions such as timetable adjustment, rescheduling or rerouting of railway traffic in case of disturbances. These delay reasons can be used to predict the lengths of railway disruptions and effective reactions can be applied in disruption management. In this work, a delay root cause discovery model is proposed, which integrates heterogeneous railway operation data sources to reconstruct the details of the railway operations. A supervised decision tree method following the machine learning and data mining techniques is designed to estimate the key factors in knock-on delays. It discovers the root cause delay factor by logically analyzing the scheduled or un-scheduled trains meetings and overtaking behaviors, and the subsequent delay propagations. Experiment results show that the proposed decision tree can predict the delay reason with the accuracy of 83%, and it can be further enhance to 90% if the delay cause is only considered “prolonged passengers boarding” and “meeting or overtaking” factors. The delay root cause can be discovered by the proposed model, verified by frequency filtering in operation records, and resolved by the adjustment of timetable which is an important reference for the next timetable rescheduling. The results of this study can be applied to railway operation decision support and disruption management, especially with regard to timetable rescheduling, trains resequencing or rerouting, system reliability analysis, and service quality improvements."

The ensemble model uses a disparate set of models, two statistical and one simulation-based to generate forecasts of train delays. The first statistical model is a context-aware random forest that accounts for network traffic states, such as likely stretch conflicts and current headway’s, exogenous weather, event, and work zone information. The second model is a kernel regression that captures train-specific dynamics. A mesoscopic simulation model that accounts for travel and dwell time variations as well as inferred track occupation conflicts, train connections and rolling stock rotations, is additionally considered. The models have been used in a proof of concept to forecast delays for nationwide passenger services network of Deutsche Bahn, which operates roughly 25,000 trains daily in Germany. Results demonstrate a 25% improvement potential in forecast correctness (fraction of predictions within one minute) and 50% reduction in root mean squared errors compared to the published schedule. The paper describes the models along with the big data challenges that were addressed in data storage, feature and model building, and computation."
